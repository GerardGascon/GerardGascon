# Hey! I'm Geri!

Hey! I'm Gerard, also known as Geri, a young student who makes games as a hobby.

Nowadays I have as a hobby game development, specifically the programming part, made games in Unity and currently experimenting with Mega Drive homebrew development using SGDK.

# Current project

### Mega Drive Project

Making a Mega Drive game in 2021

The **SEGA Mega Drive** is quite an old console right? But that's no reason for not trying to make a game, so here I am, procrastinating while trying to accomplish my goal to complete a full game that can runs on original hardware without any problem.

# Projects

### Plugins
