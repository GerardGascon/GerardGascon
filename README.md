# Hey! I'm Geri!

Hey! I'm Gerard, also known as Geri, a young student who makes games as a hobby.

Nowadays I have as a hobby game development, specifically the programming part, made games in for PC with Unity, Mega Drive with SGDK and also been experimenting with some hardware development.

# Projects

### Researches

- [Game development in 16-bits](https://www.url.edu/sites/default/files/content/file/2022/06/02/36/premisrecercaurl2022_desenvolupament-de-videojocs-en-16-bits.-gerard-gascon-moline.pdf): Nowadays, most of the video games are developed using game engines created specifically for them. Whether it is using Unity, Unreal Engine or any other piece of software, developers create them using the maximum of facilities that today’s technology provides. Despite that, there’s a small group of people that do not try to make use of that, instead they develop games for retro consoles that have been obsolete for years or even decades. These games are called 'homebrew' games, and this research project is all about developing a 'homebrew' game for a 30-year-old games console using today’s technology. This research has been presented in [XXIII Exporecerca Jove](https://www.magmarecerca.org/ca/exporecerca), [LIYSF Virtual 2022](https://www.liysf.org.uk/) and at a local presentation that you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0jH8xeC6k) (Catalan only).
- [Yet Another World’s Worst Video Card](https://hackaday.io/project/186465-yet-another-worlds-worst-video-card): A simple research based on Ben Eater’s video series about building a video card on breadboards. In this project I reduce the memory usage by only having 1-bit images.

### Tools
